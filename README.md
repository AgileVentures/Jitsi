# Jitsi
For managing our Jitsi instance

We initially followed the [quick install guide](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md) but seems like there are settings that we must configure from the [manual install guide](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/manual-install.md).

Interestingly it seems that Jitsi is owned by [Atlassian](https://jitsi.org/news/the-atlassian-acquisition-3-years-later/) and they require signing of documents before anyone can contribute to open source jitsi.
